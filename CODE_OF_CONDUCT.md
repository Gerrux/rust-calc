# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

* Being respectful of differing opinions and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information without permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Project maintainers have the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits,
code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of
Conduct.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/),
